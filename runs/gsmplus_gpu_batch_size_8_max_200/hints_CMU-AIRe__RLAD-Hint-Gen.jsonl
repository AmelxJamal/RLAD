If packages cost $3.00 each and you need 4, the cost is $12.00.

It works because time is inversely proportional to rate.</description>\n  <example>Suppose a speaker normally types at 60 WPM and then doubles speed. To type 300 words, compute time = 300 ÷ (60 × 2) = 2.5 minutes.</example>\n</note1>\n2. <note2>\n  <description>When a process is limited by a fixed duration, use the minimum of (total words ÷ new rate) and (available time). This ensures you don’t exceed the time constraint. It’s useful in scenarios with time caps.</description>\n  <example>If a machine can run for 10 minutes but needs to process 200 items at 20 items per minute, compute time = 200 ÷ 20 = 10 minutes, so it finishes exactly within the cap.</example>\n</note3>\n3. <note3>\n  <description>Always check that the new rate does not exceed the maximum capacity. If the rate × time exceeds the total words, the process is impossible. This guards against overestimating.</description>\n  <example>With a 5-minute window and a target of 150 words, if the rate is 30 WPM, compute 30 × 5 = 150 words, so it’s feasible. If rate were 35 WPM, 35 × 5 = 175 &gt; 150, so it’s impossible.</example>\n</note4>\n4. <note4>\n  <description>Use unit consistency: convert all time units to the same base (e.g., minutes) before dividing by words per minute. Mixing units leads to errors. Always align numerator and denominator units.</description>\n  <example>If a task takes 1.5 hours and you need words per minute, convert 1.5 hours to 90 minutes before dividing by words per minute.</example>\n</note5>\n5. <note5>\n  <description>After computing time, verify by reversing the calculation: multiply the computed time by the rate to see if you recover the original total words. This check catches arithmetic mistakes.</description>\n  <example>If you find time = 4 minutes at 50 WPM, then 50 × 4 = 200 words.

This ensures the answer makes sense in context.</description>\n    <example>Verify 3·(7.5–5)=3·2.5=7.5 matches the current age, and confirm 7.5+4=11.5 is a valid future age.</example>", "ended_with_eos": true, "hit_max_new_tokens": false, "gpu_before": {"available": true, "timestamp": "2026/01/12 15:12:52.645", "index": "0", "clocks_sm_mhz": "1980", "clocks_mem_mhz": "3201", "util_gpu_pct": "71", "util_mem_pct": "20", "power_w": "304.29", "temp_c": "48"}, "gpu_after": {"available": true, "timestamp": "2026/01/12 15:15:07.423", "index": "0", "clocks_sm_mhz": "1980", "clocks_mem_mhz": "3201", "util_gpu_pct": "98", "util_mem_pct": "35", "power_w": "508.98", "temp_c": "60"}}

This works because fractions represent parts of a whole.</description>\n  <example>For a total of T items and a fraction f, the number of items is T × f. For instance, if T = 100 and f = 1/4, then 100 × 1/4 = 25 items.</example>\n</note1>\n2. <note2>\n  <description>Convert a fraction to a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator. This simplifies arithmetic when multiplying or adding.</description>\n  <example>To convert 1/3 to a decimal, divide 1 by 3 to get approximately 0.333. Then multiply by any total, e.g., 0.333 × 120 ≈ 40.</example>\n</note2>\n3. <note3>\n  <description>Use the unit-rate method: find the time per one unit, then multiply by the number of units. This isolates the rate and scales it linearly.</description>\n  <example>If one task takes t hours, then n tasks take n × t hours. For example, if t = 0.5 hours per task and n = 60 tasks, total time = 60 × 0.5 = 30 hours.</example>\n</note3>\n4. <note4>\n  <description>Apply the inverse proportionality between number of items and time per item: if time per item decreases, total time decreases proportionally. Use T_total = (time_per_item) × (number_of_items).</description>\n  <example>If each of 50 items takes 0.2 hours, total time = 0.2 × 50 = 10 hours. If the time per item drops to 0.1 hours, total time = 0.1 × 50 = 5 hours.</example>\n</note4>\n5. <note5>\n  <description>Check consistency by verifying that the computed total time matches the sum of individual times or by reversing the calculation. This ensures no arithmetic or unit errors.</description>\n  <example>After finding total time T for n items, compute T/n to see if it equals the given time per item.
