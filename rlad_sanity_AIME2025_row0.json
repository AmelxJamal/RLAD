        "user": "CHEATSHEET:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The question is asking for the sum of all integer bases b > 9 where 17 in base b divides 97 in base b. Hmm, first, I need to recall how numbers in different bases work. So, 17_b is a two-digit number in base b. In decimal, that would be 1*b + 7. Similarly, 97_b is 9*b + 7. The problem states that 17_b divides 97_b, so (9b + 7) divided by (b + 7) should be an integer. \n\nWait, right. So the key is to find all bases b > 9 where (9b + 7) is a multiple of (b + 7). Let me write that as an equation: 9b + 7 = k*(b + 7), where k is some integer. Then, solving for k, maybe I can find the possible values of b. Alternatively, maybe I can perform polynomial division or use the remainder theorem. \n\nLet me think. If I divide 9b + 7 by b + 7, the remainder should be zero. Let's do the division. Let me write 9b + 7 divided by b + 7. The divisor is b + 7. The dividend is 9b + 7. Let me subtract 9*(b + 7) from the dividend. That would be 9b + 63. So, 9b +7 - 9b -63 = -56. So the remainder is -56. Therefore, for the division to be exact, the remainder must be zero. So, -56 must be divisible by (b + 7). Wait, but the remainder is -56, so that means that (b + 7) must divide -56. But since b is a base greater than 9, b + 7 is a positive integer greater than 16. So, the divisors of 56 that are greater than 16. \n\nWait, but the remainder is -56, so (b + 7) divides 56. Because if the remainder is -56, then (b + 7) divides 56. So, the possible values of (b + 7) are the positive divisors of 56 that are greater than 16 (since b > 9 implies b +7 > 16). Let me list the divisors of 56. The divisors of 56 are 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 28, 56. Now, which of these are greater than 16? 28 and 56. So, b +7 can be 28 or 56. Therefore, b is 21 or 49. \n\nWait, but let me check. If b +7 is 28, then b is 21. Then, check if 17_21 divides 97_21. Let's convert them to decimal. 17_21 is 1*21 +7 = 28. 97_21 is 9*21 +7 = 189 +7 = 196. Then 196 divided by 28 is 7, which is an integer. So that works. Similarly, for b +7 =56, b is 49. Then 17_49 is 1*49 +7 =56. 97_49 is 9*49 +7 = 441 +7=448. 448 divided by 56 is 8, which is also an integer. So those are valid. \n\nBut wait, are there any other divisors? Let me check again. The divisors of 56 are 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 28, 56. So 28 and 56 are the ones greater than 16. So that gives two bases, 21 and 49. Therefore, the sum is 21 +49=70. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"sum of all integer bases b>9\". So the answer is 70. But the problem is to generate a cheatsheet. So the notes should be about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, convert the numbers to decimal. Then set up the divisibility condition. Then perform division and find the remainder. Then set the remainder to zero and find the divisors. Then check the constraints on the base. \n\nSo the first note would be about converting the numbers to decimal. The second note is about setting up the divisibility equation. The third note is about finding the remainder and setting it to zero. The fourth note is about finding the divisors of the remainder. The fifth note is about checking the constraints on the base. \n\nWait, but the problem says to write 3-6 notes. Let me structure them. \n\nNote 1: Convert 17_b and 97_b to decimal. \n\nNote 2: Set up the divisibility condition (9b +7) / (b +7) is integer. \n\nNote 3: Perform division to find remainder, which is -56, so (b +7) divides 56. \n\nNote 4: Find divisors of 56 greater than 16 (since b>9 implies b+7>16). \n\nNote 5: Calculate the corresponding b values and sum them. \n\nAlternatively, maybe combine some steps. For example, note 3 and 4 can be combined. \n\nBut the user wants 3-6 notes. Let me check the example. The example given in the problem is a problem, and the user wants the cheatsheet. So the notes should be general steps. \n\nSo, the first note is converting the numbers to decimal. The second is setting up the equation. The third is finding the remainder and setting it to zero. The fourth is finding the divisors. The fifth is checking the constraints. \n\nBut maybe the third note can be about the remainder. So, the notes would be:\n\n1. Convert 17_b and 97_b to decimal: 1*b +7 and 9*b +7.\n\n2. Set up the divisibility condition: (9b +7) / (b +7) must be integer.\n\n3. Perform division to find remainder: remainder is -56, so (b +7) divides 56.\n\n4. Find all divisors of 56 greater than 16 (since b>9 implies b+7>16).\n\n5. Calculate b for each divisor and sum them.\n\nBut maybe the third note can be combined with the fourth. Alternatively, maybe the third note is about the remainder, and the fourth is about the divisors. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the third note is about the remainder, and the fourth is about the divisors.

So that's three notes. Wait\n\nPROBLEM:\nFind the sum of all integer bases $b>9$ for which $17_b$ is a divisor of $97_b.$\n"

Wait, but the remainder is -56, so that means that (b + 7) must divide -56. But since b is a base greater than 9, b + 7 is a positive integer greater than 16. So, the divisors of 56 that are greater than 16. \n\nWait, but the remainder is -56, so (b + 7) divides 56. Because if the remainder is -56, then (b + 7) divides 56. So, the possible values of (b + 7) are the positive divisors of 56 that are greater than 16 (since b > 9 implies b +7 > 16). Let me list the divisors of 56. The divisors of 56 are 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 28, 56. Now, which of these are greater than 16? 28 and 56. So, b +7 can be 28 or 56. Therefore, b is 21 or 49. \n\nWait, but let me check. If b +7 is 28, then b is 21. Then, check if 17_21 divides 97_21. Let's convert them to decimal. 17_21 is 1*21 +7 = 28. 97_21 is 9*21 +7 = 189 +7 = 196. Then 196 divided by 28 is 7, which is an integer. So that works. Similarly, for b +7 =56, b is 49. Then 17_49 is 1*49 +7 =56. 97_49 is 9*49 +7 = 441 +7=448. 448 divided by 56 is 8, which is also an integer. So those are valid. \n\nBut wait, are there any other divisors? Let me check again. The divisors of 56 are 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 28, 56. So 28 and 56 are the ones greater than 16. So that gives two bases, 21 and 49.

      "solver_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is asking for the sum of all integer bases $ b > 9 $ where the number $ 17_b $ divides $ 97_b $. \n\nFirst, I need to recall how numbers in different bases work. In base $ b $, the number $ 17_b $ represents $ 1 \\times b + 7 $ in decimal, right? Similarly, $ 97_b $ is $ 9 \\times b + 7 $. So, converting both numbers to decimal, we have:\n\n- $ 17_b = b + 7 $\n- $ 97_b = 9b + 7 $\n\nThe problem states that $ 17_b $ divides $ 97_b $, which means that when we divide $ 9b + 7 $ by $ b + 7 $, the result should be an integer. So, mathematically, this can be written as:\n\n$$\n\\frac{9b + 7}{b + 7} \\text{ is an integer}\n$$\n\nNow, to find the values of $ b $ that satisfy this condition, I need to analyze the division. Let me perform the division of $ 9b + 7 $ by $ b + 7 $. \n\nUsing polynomial division or the remainder theorem, I can find the remainder when $ 9b + 7 $ is divided by $ b + 7 $. Let me try the remainder theorem. If I consider the polynomial $ 9b + 7 $, then dividing by $ b + 7 $, the remainder is the value of the polynomial at $ b = -7 $. \n\nCalculating that:\n\n$$\n9(-7) + 7 = -63 + 7 = -56\n$$\n\nSo, the remainder is -56. Therefore, for the division to result in an integer, the remainder must be zero. That means:\n\n$$\n-56 \\equiv 0 \\mod (b + 7)\n$$\n\nWhich implies that $ b + 7 $ must be a divisor of 56. However, since $ b > 9 $, $ b + 7 > 16 $, so we need to find all positive divisors of 56 that are greater than 16. \n\nLet me list the divisors of 56. The prime factorization of 56 is $ 2^3 \\times 7 $, so the divisors are:\n\n1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 28, 56.\n\nNow, from these, the ones greater than 16 are 28 and 56. Therefore, $ b + 7 $ can be 28 or 56, which gives:\n\n- If $ b + 7 = 28 $, then $ b = 21 $\n- If $ b + 7 = 56 $, then $ b = 49 $\n\nNow, I need to check if these values of $ b $ satisfy the original condition. Let's verify:\n\nFor $ b = 21 $:\n\n- $ 17_{21} = 1 \\times 21 + 7 = 28 $\n- $ 97_{21} = 9 \\times 21 + 7 = 189 + 7 = 196 $\n- $ 196 \\div 28 = 7 $, which is an integer. So, valid.\n\nFor $ b = 49 $:\n\n- $ 17_{49} = 1 \\times 49 + 7 = 56 $\n- $ 97_{49} = 9 \\times 49 + 7 = 441 + 7 = 448 $\n- $ 448 \\div 56 = 8 $, which is an integer. So, valid.\n\nTherefore, the valid bases are 21 and 49. The sum of these bases is $ 21 + 49 = 70 $.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure there are no other divisors. The divisors of 56 greater than 16 are indeed 28 and 56. Since 56 is the largest divisor, and 28 is the next. So, no other divisors. Hence, only two bases.\n\nSo, the final answer is 70. The steps are:\n\n1. Convert the numbers to decimal: $ 17_b = b + 7 $, $ 97_b = 9b + 7 $.\n2. Set up the divisibility condition: $ \\frac{9b + 7}{b + 7} $ must be an integer.\n3. Perform division to find the remainder, which is -56, so $ b + 7 $ divides 56.\n4. Find divisors of 56 greater than 16: 28 and 56.\n5. Calculate corresponding $ b $ values: 21 and 49.\n6. Sum the valid bases: 21 + 49 = 70.\n\nTherefore, the sum is 70.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the sum of all integer bases $ b > 9 $ for which $ 17_b $ divides $ 97_b $, we proceed as follows:\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Convert the Numbers to Decimal**\n\nIn base $ b $, the number $ 17_b $ represents:\n$$\n17_b = 1 \\cdot b + 7 = b + 7\n$$\nThe number $ 97_b $ represents:\n$$\n97_b = 9 \\cdot b + 7 = 9b + 7\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Set Up the Divisibility Condition**\n\nWe are given that $ 17_b $ divides $ 97_b $, which means:\n$$\n\\frac{9b + 7}{b + 7} \\text{ is an integer}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Perform Polynomial Division**\n\nDivide $ 9b + 7 $ by $ b + 7 $.

      "solver_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to solve this problem. The question is asking for the sum of all integer bases b > 9 for which 17_b is a divisor of 97_b. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what 17_b and 97_b represent in decimal. Let me recall that in base b, the number 17_b is equal to 1*b^1 + 7*b^0, which is b + 7. Similarly, 97_b is 9*b^1 + 7*b^0, which is 9b + 7. \n\nSo the problem reduces to finding all integers b > 9 such that b + 7 divides 9b + 7. In other words, (b + 7) divides (9b + 7). \n\nLet me write this as a divisibility condition. If (b + 7) divides (9b + 7), then there exists some integer k such that 9b + 7 = k*(b + 7). \n\nAlternatively, using the Euclidean algorithm, we can think of this as (9b + 7) mod (b + 7) = 0. Let me compute this modulo operation. \n\nLet me perform the division of 9b + 7 by b + 7. Let me think of it as polynomial division. \n\nDivide 9b + 7 by b + 7. The leading term is 9b divided by b, which is 9. Multiply (b + 7) by 9: 9b + 63. Subtract this from 9b + 7: (9b + 7) - (9b + 63) = -56. Therefore, 9b + 7 = 9*(b + 7) - 56. \n\nTherefore, the remainder is -56. So for (b + 7) to divide 9b + 7, the remainder must be zero. Therefore, -56 ≡ 0 mod (b + 7). Which implies that b + 7 divides 56. \n\nWait, because if -56 ≡ 0 mod (b + 7), then b + 7 divides 56. Since -56 is congruent to 0 mod (b + 7), then b + 7 must be a divisor of 56. \n\nBut since b > 9, then b + 7 > 16. Therefore, we need to find all divisors of 56 that are greater than 16, and then subtract 7 to get b. \n\nWait, let me check that again. Let me rephrase. \n\nWe have that b + 7 divides 56. So, b + 7 is a positive divisor of 56. Since b > 9, then b + 7 > 16. Therefore, we need to find all positive divisors of 56 that are greater than 16, then subtract 7 to get b. \n\nFirst, let's find all positive divisors of 56. The prime factorization of 56 is 2^3 * 7^1. Therefore, the divisors are:\n\n1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 28, 56. \n\nSo the positive divisors are these numbers. Now, we need those divisors that are greater than 16. Let's check each:\n\n1: nope, 1 <16\n\n2: nope\n\n4: nope\n\n7: nope\n\n8: nope\n\n14: 14 <16, so nope\n\n28: yes, 28>16\n\n56: yes, 56>16\n\nSo the divisors greater than 16 are 28 and 56. Therefore, b + 7 is either 28 or 56. Therefore, solving for b:\n\nCase 1: b + 7 = 28 → b = 21\n\nCase 2: b + 7 = 56 → b = 49\n\nSo the possible bases are 21 and 49. Then the sum of these bases is 21 + 49 = 70. \n\nWait, but let me check if there are any other divisors. Wait, 56 is 56, and 28 is 28. Are there any other divisors? Let me check again. The divisors of 56 are 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 28, 56. So yes, only 28 and 56. \n\nBut let me confirm that these are indeed valid. Let me check for b=21 and b=49.\n\nFirst, check for b=21:\n\n17_b is 1*21 +7 = 28. 97_b is 9*21 +7 = 189 +7=196. Then check if 28 divides 196. 196 divided by 28 is 7, since 28*7=196. Yes, that works.\n\nFor b=49:\n\n17_b is 1*49 +7 = 56. 97_b is 9*49 +7 = 441 +7=448. Check if 56 divides 448. 448 /56 = 8. Yes, 56*8=448. Correct.\n\nSo these are valid. Are there any other divisors? For example, if b +7 is negative? But since b>9, then b +7 is positive. So negative divisors would not be considered here. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"integer bases b>9\". So b must be positive integers greater than 9. Therefore, the possible values are 21 and 49. Their sum is 21 +49=70. \n\nBut wait, let me check if there are other divisors. For example, if I consider that maybe b +7 divides 56, but maybe there are other divisors? For example, if I think of 56's divisors, but maybe I missed something. \n\nWait, 56 is 2^3 *7. So the divisors are indeed as above. So only 28 and 56. Therefore, the answer is 21 +49=70. \n\nBut let me check again. Wait, another thought: when we said that b +7 divides 56, but maybe there's another way to approach this. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, using the equation:\n\nWe have that (b +7) divides (9b +7). So, (9b +7) / (b +7) must be integer. Let me write this as:\n\nLet me rearrange the equation. Let me write 9b +7 = k*(b +7). Then, solving for k:\n\n9b +7 = k*b +7k → 9b -k*b = 7k -7 → b*(9 -k) = 7(k -1). Therefore, b = [7(k -1)] / (9 -k). \n\nBut since b must be an integer greater than 9, we can look for integer values of k such that this gives integer b. \n\nAlternatively, maybe this approach is more complicated. But perhaps I can find k such that this is possible. \n\nAlternatively, since we already found that b +7 divides 56, and that gives us the possible values, maybe that's the correct way. \n\nAlternatively, another approach: Let me use the Euclidean algorithm. \n\nWe have that (9b +7) divided by (b +7) gives a remainder of -56, as we found earlier. Therefore, (b +7) divides 56. Therefore, the possible values of b +7 are the positive divisors of 56 greater than 16. Which gives us 28 and 56. Therefore, the answer is 21 +49=70. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 70. \n\nBut let me check if there are other possible divisors. For example, if b +7 is a divisor of 56, but maybe negative divisors? But since b>9, then b +7 is positive, so negative divisors would not be considered. \n\nSo yes, the answer is 70. \n\nWait, but let me check if there are other divisors. For example, 56 divided by 28 is 2, but 28 is already considered. What about 56? 56 is a divisor. So yes, only 28 and 56. \n\nTherefore, the sum is 21 +49=70. \n\nI think that's correct. So the final answer is \\boxed{70}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we are given that the base-$b$ numbers $17_b$ and $97_b$ must satisfy the condition that $17_b$ divides $97_b$. \n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Convert the base-$b$ numbers to decimal\n\n- $17_b = 1 \\cdot b + 7 = b + 7$\n- $97_b = 9 \\cdot b + 7 = 9b + 7$",
